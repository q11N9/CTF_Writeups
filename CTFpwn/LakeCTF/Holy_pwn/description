Countless pwns led you to this final challenge. In front of you, the Temple of God stands massive. This challenge will require something that trascends Linux; something only possible in the realm of God. A Holy Pwn!

Note: it's a stock image of ZealOS. Chall.ZC is the only added file (minor modifications done to Once.ZC and HomeSys.ZC but only to remove annoying irrelevant stuff) Note: if you are experiencing hitting the same breakpoint over and over, take a step back and think for a bit before panicking and assuming something is broken
